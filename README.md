# Medicin_Data_Scraper
A Python project that scrapes health-related information (e.g., about Diabetes) from MedlinePlus using BeautifulSoup. The data—including headings and paragraphs—is extracted, cleaned, and stored in CSV format. This project demonstrates how to automate medical data extraction for research or educational use.
